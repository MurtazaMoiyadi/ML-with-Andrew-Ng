# [Coursera Machine Learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 

This repository contains the python versions of the programming assignments for [Stanford's Machine Learning online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Professor Andrew Ng. 

## Summary
- The assignments use [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html), which provides an intuitive flow easier than the original MATLAB/OCTAVE assignments.
- The original assignment instructions have been completely re-written and the parts which used to reference MATLAB/OCTAVE functionality have been changed to reference its `python` counterpart.
- The re-written instructions are now embedded within the Jupyter Notebook along with the `python` starter code. For each assignment, all work is done solely within the notebook.
- The `python` assignments can be submitted for grading. They were tested to work perfectly well with the original Coursera grader that is currently used to grade the MATLAB/OCTAVE versions of the assignments. 
- After each part of a given assignment, the Jupyter Notebook contains a cell which prompts the user for submitting the current part of the assignment for grading.
